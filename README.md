[Based on ZeroGwafa's Seren Tracker](https://github.com/ZeroGwafa/SerenTracker/tree/master)

For those of you who want to track what those pumpkins give you, I reworked the Seren Tracker to work for the Pumpkins.

![example](/readme-assets/example.png)

# How to install:

* Go to the browser inside Alt1 toolkit
* Visit `https://exinferi.nl/apps/PumpkinTracker`
* Hit the yellow 'add app' button in the upper right corner.
* **Make sure to turn chatfilter off and turn timestamps on!**

Have fun tracking!

# Known issues:

* With chat box text size set to 10pt, the party pumpkins aren't logged. This can be worked around by setting the size to 12pt.

# Updates:

**Update 16 Oct, 13:00 Game Time**:

Added support for the Party Pumpkins. Hovering over the item now also shows how you got it, and this is also added to the CSV export.

**Update 16 Oct, 15:45 Game Time**:

Implemented a fix to correctly log the type of "Overhead Emotes" received. Requires reload of the app in order to take effect.

**Update 21 Oct, 11:30 Game Time:**

The app now shows the total pumpkins captured. You can disable this in the settings. For currently active users, this requires a reload of the app.

**Update 21 Oct, 15:30 Game Time:**

Added new display options. Clicking the header now cycles in this order: `Pumpkin Item History > Smashing Pumpkin Totals > Party Pumpkin Totals > Pumpkin Item Totals`The export function has been adjusted accordingly, so you can now separately export all total rewards from Smashing Pumpkins as well as Party Pumpkins. As with previous updates, this requires a reload for current active users.
