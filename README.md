### Enable Edit

Enabling this will enable a couple editable options.

First, the "Hide" column will become visible.  This will allow the user to hide specific columns, regardless of Qty.

Next, the Qty and Goal boxes for each material can be edited.  Useful for tracking your current material count, or setting goals for certain materials.

When setting a goal, once the Qty amount is greater than, or equal to the goal, the material row will highlight in green.

### Select Chat
When opening the app, it will detect all visible chat windows.  You can use this option to have the app target a specific window (The default is the window closest to the top-left of the screen).  When selecting a different window, a white box will surround the selected chat window briefly to show which chat you have selected.
