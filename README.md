# BeachTracker

[Based on ZeroGwafa's Seren Tracker](https://github.com/ZeroGwafa/SerenTracker/tree/master)

For those of you who want to track what rewards the Beach gives you, I reworked the Seren Tracker to work for the skilling, clawdia and pi√±ata loot bag drops.

## How to install

Go to [the app](https://exinferi.nl/apps/beach) in your browser and click the link, or:

1. Go to the browser inside Alt1 toolkit
2. Visit `https://exinferi.nl/apps/beach`
3. Hit the yellow 'add app' button in the upper right corner.

**Make sure to turn chatfilter off and turn timestamps on!**

Have fun tracking!

## Known issues  

* It does not track oddments, as they don't use the regular reward text and can't currently be tracked in a reliable manner.
* May behave odd with size 10 chat.
